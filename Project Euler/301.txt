Generally, we have
(x ^ y) + 2 * (x & y) = x + y

Let x = n, y = 2n.
(n ^ 2n) + 2 * (n & 2n) = 3n

So the following conditions are all equivalent.

* X(n, 2n, 3n) = 0
* n ^ 2n ^ 3n = 0
* n ^ 2n = 3n
* n & 2n = 0
* n doesn't have consecutive 1's in binary expression

So, total is a fibonacci number
